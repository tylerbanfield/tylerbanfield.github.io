<h1>Use Content to Get More Out of SaaS Marketing Channels</h1>

<p>In <a href="http://tomtunguz.com/five-marketing-channels-saas-companies/">The 5 Marketing Channels of Great SaaS Companies</a>, VC Thomas Tunguz covers channels, user actions, content marketing, advertising and events. In the section about content marketing, Tunguz states that <em>“content marketing is the only channel with compounding and long term returns.”</em></p>
 
<p>He reemphasizes this benefit by pointing out that <em>“the right kinds of content can generate leads for years, unlike the fleeting clicks of a paid marketing campaign.”</em></p>
 
<p>While I wholeheartedly agree with the view Tunguz takes of content marketing, I thought this would be a great opportunity to provide some examples of how content can be used to <strong>get more out of</strong> the other four SaaS marketing channels as well:</p>
 
<h2>1. Channel Partners & Integrations</h2>
 
<p>Tunguz explains that even though SaaS exists in a different ecosystem than VARs and ISVs, <em>“SaaS companies still do have channels available to them in the form of app stores.”</em> While he points out Salesforce, Intuit, Google, Apple and Android app stores, that’s really just the tip of the iceberg.</p>
 
<p>As Lars Lofgren detailed in a <a href="https://blog.kissmetrics.com/find-more-saas-customers/">Kissmetrics</a> post, Shopify, Box, 37Signals, Yammer, Constant Contact, MailChimp and FreshBooks all offer integration opportunities.</p>
 
<p>Since building one or more integrations will require time and effort, you don’t want to build an integration and then just move on. Instead, you should <strong>kick it off</strong> with a big marketing push that includes both an announcement post and a guest post.</p>
 
<p>Because Zapier is the current king of integrations, I highly recommend their extremely actionable <a href="https://zapier.com/blog/marketing-app-integrations/">12 Marketing Lessons Learned from 60 App Integrations in 6 Months</a> post.</p>
 
<h2>2. User Actions</h2>
 
<p>Examples of this channel include Dropbox’s refer a friend program, along with similar initiatives from Evernote, DigitalOcean, EventBrite and Elance. While referral marketing is often limited to a small footer link, any SaaS that’s seeing solid results from this channel can use content to ramp up participation.</p>
 
<p>In addition to using <strong>lifecycle emails</strong> to provide timely reminders about why users should refer others, periodic blog posts featuring conversations with users who have the most referrals could work great for both increasing interest in the program and helping to build a sense of community.</p>
 
<h2>3. Advertising</h2>
 
<p>Tunguz says that <em>“the simpler and more consumer-like the product, the more likely paid ads are to immediately trigger a download or a signup.”</em> He also adds that <em>“paid ads are sometimes used to drive potential buyers to white papers and other content, but this can get pretty expensive really quickly.”</em></p>
 
<p>Although it’s definitely true that any form of paid advertising can get expensive very quickly, the right content can <strong>actually decrease costs</strong>.</p>
 
<p>For example, when Radius made some major changes to their product, they decided to test several different CTAs across multiple ad channels. Here are <a href="https://marketeer.kapost.com/paid-ads-content-marketing/">their results</a>:</p>

<ul> 
<li><em>Download Cheat Sheet</em> generated 93% of total leads from campaign</li>
<li><em>Learn More</em> generated 5% of total leads from campaign</li>
<li><em>Sign Up for Demo</em> generated 2% of total leads from campaign</li>
</ul>
 
<h2>4. Events</h2>
 
<p>While most bootstrappers are unlikely to throw the type of $250-$500k events that Tunguz references, hosting smaller events can be a very smart strategy. Brennan Dunn actually used a strategic combination of an email list and hosting networking mixers to build his first agency.</p>
 
<p>Another strategy to consider is using any events that you attend as an opportunity to create content. My favorite example of this strategy in action is the awesome <a href="https://kaidavis.com/microconf-2015/">Microconf 2015 Recap Page</a> Kai Davis assembled on his website.</p>
 
<p>As these examples show, by thinking of how content can be used across all their marketing channels, SaaS companies can get an even better return on their marketing investments.</p>
