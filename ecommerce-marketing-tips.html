<h1>7 Marketing Tips for New Ecommerce Businesses</h1>
 
<p>It's easier than ever before to get an ecommerce website up and running. The same is true for making this type of website look and function great on screens of all sizes. However, that doesn't mean it's easy to grow an ecommerce site into a meaningful business.  Achieving that goal requires getting targeted visitors to your website and then converting them into customers. Since <strong>many new businesses struggle</strong> to find the right growth strategies, here are seven proven marketing tips you can implement in your ecommerce business:</p>
 
<h2>1. Don't Be Shy About Collecting Email Addresses</h2>
 
<p>Out of every one hundred people who visit your website for the first time, it's unlikely that more than a few will actually buy. Because the rest are going to leave and may forget about your website, you should try to get their email address. By displaying a popup that offers a discount or other incentive in exchange for someone's email address, you can gain an opportunity to build relationships with people who are interested in your business and eventually convert more of them into customers.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.optimonk.com/blog/popup-case-studies/">Countless case studies</a> have shown that as long as what you're offering in exchange for email addresses has value and the popup can be easily closed if someone isn't interested, this strategy will help grow the customer base for your ecommerce business.</p>
 
<h2>2. Implement a Discount Ladder</h2>
 
<p>A discount ladder is a way to increase the likelihood of both potential and existing customers making a purchase. You can set up a discount ladder by <strong>creating automated rules</strong> in your email marketing platform. As an example, the first rule may send an email with a ten percent discount to someone on your list who hasnâ€™t made a purchase in the last thirty days. If they still don't buy, the next rule will send a twenty percent discount after sixty days, and then a thirty percent discount after ninety days. You can customize the percents and intervals to best fit your specific ecommerce business.</p>
 
<h2>3. Talk to Your Customers</h2>
 
<p>One of the advantages of ecommerce is you don't have to find a physical storefront to lease. You also don't have to go door to door in search of customers. This convenience often leads to new ecommerce businesses selling to dozens or even hundreds of customers without ever talking to them. But by making an effort to <strong>speak with customers</strong> whenever possible, you'll learn what matters most to them about your business. You can then take that knowledge and use it to optimize elements of your business like product descriptions.</p> 
 
<h2>4. Use Instagram to Engage</h2>
 
<p>Instagram is a great platform for showing off physical products. It's also a very popular platform filled with posts from millions of people and businesses. Standing out and reaching a meaningful number of potential customers requires more than simply posting great pictures. It's <strong>important to engage</strong> by liking other pictures and posting quality comments. This is something you can do with people who are likely to be potential customers, along with other businesses that are complementary to yours.</p>
 
<h2>5. Shoot a Video</h2>
 
<p>Even though billions of videos are watched on YouTube every day and platforms like Facebook are making significant investments in this medium, most ecommerce businesses still aren't using video. Shooting a video provides the opportunity to show off your products and talk about them directly to viewers. It's also easier than ever to shoot a video that looks great thanks to the quality of cameras in devices like the iPhone. And once a video is complete, you can post it on your ecommerce website and then share it across multiple platforms.</p> 
 
<h2>6. Make the Most of Returns</h2>
 
<p>Returns are an unavoidable part of ecommerce. Instead of viewing that as a bad thing, you can use returns as an opportunity to make your business stand out. Offering a generous return policy is a <a href="http://www.utdallas.edu/news/2016/1/19-31863_Researchers-Examine-Effect-of-Return-Policies-on-C_story-wide.html?WT.mc_id=NewsEmail">proven way</a> to give people the confidence they need to actually buy. Being prompt and communicative with customers during the return process can unearth information you can use to improve your products or overall business. It's also a great way to create a positive impression with people that will make them want to recommend your business to others.</p> 
 
<h2>7. Offer Gift Cards</h2>
 
<p>Consumers buy more than one hundred billion dollars in gift cards every year. Offering gift cards for your business through your ecommerce website will allow you to market to new segments of people who may not be personally interested in your products but do want to give them as a present to someone else. Gift cards can also be used as a compelling incentive for promotions to existing customers.</p>
 
<p>It's not hard to find stories of ecommerce companies that read like an overnight success story. But if you dig a little deeper, chances are you'll find a lot of hard work came before a company's lucky break. That hard work often takes the form of <strong>trying out numerous marketing tactics</strong> to see which one will really move the needle.</p>

<p>If you want to put your new ecommerce business on the path to growth, it's important to not be shy about collecting email addresses, implement a discount ladder, talk to your customers and use Instagram to engage. Shooting a video, making the most of returns and offering gift cards are also marketing tactics that can help take your new business to the next level.</p>
