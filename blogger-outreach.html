<h1>5 Secrets to Blogger Outreach Success</h1>
 
 <p><em>By: Tyler Banfield</em></p>
 
<p>Publishing great blog posts or other types of online content is no longer enough to rank well in Google. Getting a page ranked at the top of Google for even a moderately competitive keyword requires incoming links. Since paying for links is against Google’s quality guidelines and can result in an entire website being penalized, you need a different strategy for acquiring links.</p>
 
<p>One strategy that can work very well is blogger outreach. This strategy involves reaching out to bloggers and asking them to share or link to a specific piece of content. Although blogger outreach can be <strong>very effective</strong>, that doesn’t mean it’s easy. Bloggers of all sizes receive many requests for shares and links. The good news is a lot of those requests are spam that may not even be relevant to a blogger’s niche.</p>
 
<p>A big part of what all bloggers do is expose their audiences to useful content that’s relevant to their interests. So if you produce that type of content and then take the right approach to reaching out to bloggers, you’ll reap all the <strong>traffic benefits</strong> that go along with getting a page to rank well in Google.</p>
 
<p>Once you’ve created a <a href="http://suncitydigital.com/content">great piece of content</a> that provides genuine value in the form of entertainment, original data or actionable information, here are the five keys to successfully reaching out to bloggers:</p>
 
<h2>1. Warm Relationships Are Better Than Cold Outreach</h2>
 
<p>The odds of getting a share or link from a blogger who’s never heard of you are slim. You can <strong>greatly improve</strong> the likelihood of a blogger responding by establishing a relationship before you ever send a pitch. Sharing their content on Twitter and leaving insightful comments on posts are examples of how to build initial rapport with a blogger.</p>
 
<h2>2. Only Choose Relevant Bloggers</h2>
 
<p>If you’re going to ask a blogger to link to one of your posts, it has to be very relevant to the blogger’s audience. It can be tempting to increase your outreach list by including bloggers with audiences that are only somewhat relevant to your content. But by resisting that temptation and limiting your outreach efforts to only the most relevant bloggers, you’ll ultimately get better results.</p>
 
<h2>3. Craft The Right Pitch</h2>
 
<p>The pitch you email to a blogger should be <strong>less than seven sentences</strong> in length. Your pitch should get to the point by mentioning what you’ve done for the blogger and why you think the specific piece of content you want linked to will provide value to the blogger’s audience.</p>
 
<h2>4. Follow Up Through a Different Channel</h2>
 
<p>Bloggers receive a lot of emails. When you don’t receive a response to your pitch, it may simply be the result of a blogger overlooking it. That’s why it’s worth following up to your initial pitch through a different channel like Twitter. You should do this <strong>around a week</strong> after your first email. If you still don’t get a response, avoid taking it personally and move on with your outreach efforts.</p>
 
<h2>5. Make Outreach An Ongoing Process</h2>
 
<p>Even when you follow the steps outlined above, blogger outreach is still a numbers game. The people who get the best results from this strategy are those who do it on an ongoing basis. Not only does ongoing outreach provide <strong>more opportunities for success</strong>, but it will also give you a chance to hone your efforts.</p>
 
<p>By creating a consistent outreach strategy that’s built around establishing relationships, contacting the right bloggers with a compelling pitch and following up when necessary, you will be able to rank higher in Google for many of your target keyword phrases and increase your website’s overall traffic.</p>
