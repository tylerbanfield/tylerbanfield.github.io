<h1>5 Tips to Increase Email Marketing Engagement</h1>
 
 <p><em>By: Tyler Banfield</em></p>
 
<p>One of the most common mistakes businesses make with email marketing is thinking of their email list as a single number instead of individual people. If you want to improve key email marketing metrics like open and click-through rates, it’s important to engage with recipients as individuals.</p>
 
<p>You can do this by writing your marketing emails to just one person. Even though that email may ultimately be sent to hundreds or thousands of people, <strong>focusing on writing to a single individual</strong> will change your entire approach for the better.</p>
 
<p>Based on the overall strategy of writing to just one person, here are five tips you can use to craft emails that will maximize engagement:</p>
 
<h2>1. Pick Who You’re Writing To</h2>
 
<p>If you know one of the people on your email list, write your emails directly to that individual. Even if you don’t personally know anyone on your list, you can create a <strong>recipient avatar</strong>. This type of avatar is a fictional character that represents who you’re writing to. By giving the avatar a name, physical description, job and other personality traits, it will be much easier to write emails in a personalized way.</p>
 
<h2>2. Write in First Person</h2>
 
 <p>First person means writing from your personal perspective and using the pronoun <em>I</em>. This is the same way you would write a personal email to a friend or family member. And because your goal is to write your marketing emails directly to a single recipient, use the pronoun you whenever whenever you’re speaking to the recipient.</p>
 
<h2>3. Use Your Real Name</h2>
 
<p>Businesses often use a generic email address and their brand name to send marketing emails. This makes recipients feel less engaged. You can improve engagement by using <em>yourname@business.com</em> to send your emails. You can also decide whether you want to use your last name or <em>First Name from Business Name</em> in the sender information. Complete this personalization by using a headshot instead of your business logo as the profile picture for your email account.</p>
 
<h2>4. Ask a Question</h2>
 
<p>A great way to remind recipients that an email is from a real person is to ask a question. Not only can this tactic <strong>improve engagement</strong> by encouraging responses, but it’s a great way to collect useful information from your email list.</p>
 
<h2>5. Add a P.S.</h2>
 
<p>As with other types of online content, people tend to skim emails before deciding to fully read them. You can benefit from this behavior by including a P.S. below your closing. Best practices for a P.S. in a marketing email is not writing more than two sentences and ending with a link to a relevant page on your website.</p>
 
<p>By creating a recipient avatar, writing in first person, asking a question, using your real name and adding a P.S., you will be able to improve the key email marketing metrics for your campaigns.</p>
