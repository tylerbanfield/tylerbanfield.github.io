<h1>Online Content That Gets Results</h1>
 
<p class="intro-number">1,500</p>
 
<p>That's how many possible stories Facebook said they could show someone any time they visited their News Feed at the end of 2013. Since then, the number of posts made on Facebook has continued to grow. Between 2014 and 2016, the number of Facebook posts published every 60 seconds grew from 2.46 million to 3.3 million. This same pattern of growth occurred on just about every other major online platform, including Instagram, YouTube, email and even WhatsApp.</p>
 
<h2>The Secret to Standing Out</h2>
 
<p>Although individuals, businesses and large publications are publishing more content than ever before, people's appetite for online content only continues to increase. A recent report from Nielsen found that adults spend between 23 and 32 hours a week consuming media.</p>   
 
<p>With huge media companies like The Washington Post and BuzzFeed publishing hundreds of stories every day, getting your content in front of your target audience isn't an easy task. But it's also not impossible. <strong>The key is AIDA.</strong></p>
 
<p>Even though this acronym, which stands for Attention, Interest, Desire and Action, was coined over a century ago, following it is more important than ever. Every piece of content your business produces needs a hook to immediately grab the attention of the people you want to reach. From there, it needs to quickly pique their interest so they continue reading it.</p>
 
<p>During the course of reading, your content needs to prime people's desire for the action it's going to ask them to take at the end. Content that follows the principles of Attention, Interest, Desire and has a strong call to action at the end like reading another post or signing up for your companyâ€™s email list is what can move the needle for your key online metrics.</p>
