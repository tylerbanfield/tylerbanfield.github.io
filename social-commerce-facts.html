<h1>6 Social Commerce Facts You Need to Know</h1>
 
 <p><em>By: Tyler Banfield</em></p>
 
<p>Although seventy-five percent of consumers are familiar with social commerce buy buttons, only ten percent of consumers have used this feature to make a purchase. In an effort to explain this gap, <a href="https://blog.sumoheavy.com/the-sumo-heavy-2016-social-commerce-survey-ede6e24704b4">SUMO Heavy Industries</a> surveyed over one thousand U.S. consumers in September 2016. The survey produced a lot of interesting data for marketers and business owners who sell online. Here are the six biggest social commerce takeaways from the survey:</p>
 
<h2>1. Facebook is the 800-Pound Gorilla</h2>
 
<p>With a usage rate of just under ninety percent, survey respondents were nearly <strong>three times more likely</strong> to use Facebook than any other social network. Instagram, which is now owned by Facebook, tied with Pinterest as the second most used platform. Twitter came in last place and was only used by one out of every four respondents.</p> 
 
<h2>2. Organic Content is More Influential Than Paid</h2>
 
<p>Although social networks depend on ads and sponsored posts for revenue, consumers aren't responding to them as strongly as businesses would like. Only sixteen percent of the individuals surveyed said these types of posts influenced them. In comparison, <strong>over half of the respondents</strong> were influenced by organic content like product reviews or posts made by friends about businesses.</p> 
 
<h2>3. Security is the Biggest Hurdle for Social Commerce</h2>
 
<p>Concerns related to security were the most common reason people gave for not engaging in social commerce. More specifically, people worried about submitting their financial information through a channel they viewed as insecure. The current state of social commerce features also made many individuals question whether or not they could make an actual purchase on a platform like Facebook.</p> 
 
<h2>4. Social Media Users Are Worried About Privacy</h2>
 
<p>Privacy is the other significant social commerce hang-up identified from the survey data. Respondents expressed concerns about what social platforms would do with any personal or shopping data collected during a transaction.</p> 
 
<h2>5. The Jury is Still Out on Chatbots</h2>
 
<p>Chatbots were a very popular topic in business and technology media publications during 2016. However, that enthusiasm has yet to translate to real-world behavior in the United States. <strong>Less than ten percent</strong> of respondents to the survey had tried shopping through a chatbot. And more than half of the responses indicated people currently had no interest in even trying out this type of social technology.</p> 
 
<h2>6. Women Are Most Likely to Be Social Commerce Buyers</h2>
 
<p>The consumers surveyed by SUMO Heavy Industries were split almost evenly between men and women. Data from the survey indicated that women were significantly more likely to have engaged in social commerce than men. There were also more women who considered themselves impulse online shoppers than men.</p> 
 
<p>Although Facebook has far more active users than Instagram, Pinterest or Twitter, sponsored posts <strong>still aren't as valuable</strong> to businesses as organic content. The survey data also shows that platforms must address security and privacy concerns before social commerce can expand. And while women are more likely to purchase through a social commerce buy button than men, neither group of consumers currently has much of an interest in shopping through chatbots.</p>
